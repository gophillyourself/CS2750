# a list of regexes to be called with a sed command
# all of these work with GNU sed when copied out of this text file and dropped in as a regex
# BSD sed does not recognize the 'i' flag used for ignoring case of a letter
# all but the last regex will work with regex_runner.sh because it needs the -r to use the references, or -E for POSIX systems
# all have been tested against the file input
